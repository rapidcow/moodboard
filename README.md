# moodboard --- a local-hosted alternative to Pinterest?

something for me to collect art without Pinterest?
(i just wanted to collect art WHILE giving credit where
it's due but Pinterest having these for-profit pins set up
when i never intend to claim any of the work to be mine :c)

([this](https://youtu.be/tjSxFAGP9Ss) and similar discussions
on the ethics of AI art was what motivated me to make this)

idk ueeeaahh but um thing in `example/` is how it might
look like (i use my own art not because i think they're good
but because i don't have to ask for permission)
